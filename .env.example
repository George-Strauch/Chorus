# Host filesystem path mounted into the container (e.g. /mnt/host).

# --- Host shell execution (Docker only, set automatically by run.sh) ---
# These enable nsenter-based host execution: when an agent's command
# targets the host filesystem, it runs directly on the host via nsenter,
# giving access to all host binaries (doctl, claude, etc.) and config.
# Requires pid:host + privileged:true in docker-compose.yml.
